*A guide to how we code for the web*

## Overview

The guides and linters provided here are a guide for how we, in the Spark for Developers group,
approach developing for the web. It is our means of keeping our code consistent and as a reference
for the different patterns we use. Many of the recipes and rules we've laid out are adapted from
other well known projects, or the community at large.

## Contributing

Please feel free to open issues and PRs against this repo. It is meant to be a living document.
We hope to encourage discussion and that the guide will evolve as web standards and norms change.
